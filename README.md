# Applied-ML-Assignments
Weather in Athens, guns and evil and your mood on Spotify

These are my assignments for Applied Machine Learning 7th semester course.

- The first one focuses on familiarizing with the use of `pandas` and plotting libraries by examining a dataset from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information.
- The second assignment reproduces a paper survey on guns and belief in supernatural evil by doing statistical analysis.
- The third one uses traditional machine learning techniques vs a neural network to explain valence, a Spotify metric.
